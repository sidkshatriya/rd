    ///     ptrace(tid, PTRACE_SYSCALL, ...);
    ///   }
    ///
    /// That is, the tracer is supposed to let the kernel schedule
    /// threads and then respond to notifications generated by the
    /// kernel.
    ///
    /// Obviously this isn't how rd's recorder loop looks, because,
    /// among other things, rd has to serialize thread execution.
    /// Normally this isn't much of a problem.  However, mass task
    /// death is an exception.  What happens at a mass task death
    /// is a sequence of events like the following
    ///
    ///  1. A task calls exit_group() or is sent a core-dumping
    ///     signal.
    ///  2. rd receives a PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT notification for the
    ///     task.
    ///  3. rd detaches from the dying/dead task.
    ///  4. Successive calls to waitpid(-1) generate additional
    ///     PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT notifications for each also-dead task
    ///     in the original task's thread group.  Repeat (2) / (3)
    ///     for each notified task.
    ///
    /// So why destabilization?  After (2), rd can't block on the
    /// task shutting down (`waitpid(tid)`), because the kernel
    /// harvests the LWPs (Light weight processes) of the dying thread group in an unknown
    /// order (which we shouldn't assume, even if we could guess
    /// it).  If rd blocks on the task harvest, it will (usually)
    /// deadlock.
    ///
    /// And because rd doesn't know the order of tasks that will be
    /// reaped, it doesn't know which of the dying tasks to
    /// "schedule".  If it guesses and blocks on another task in
    /// the group's status-change, it will (usually) deadlock.
    ///
    /// So destabilizing a thread group, from rd's perspective, means
    /// handing scheduling control back to the kernel and not
    /// trying to harvest tasks before detaching from them.
    ///
    /// NB: an invariant of rd scheduling is that all process
    /// status changes happen as a result of rd resuming the
    /// execution of a task.  This is required to keep tracees in
    /// known states, preventing events from happening "behind rd's
    /// back".  However, destabilizing a thread group means that
    /// these kinds of changes are possible, in theory.

    /// needed for death signals and exit_group().
